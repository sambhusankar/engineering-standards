# Emergent Structure

Structure emerges from content and connections, not rigid upfront planning.

## Principle

Let structure arise naturally from atomic notes and links rather than imposing organization beforehand.

**Why**: Rigid structures become obsolete. Emergent structures adapt naturally.

## How Structure Emerges

1. **Write atomic notes** without worrying about perfect organization
2. **Add cross-links** between related concepts
3. **Natural groups emerge** as similar notes cluster
4. **Create subdirectories** when 8+ related notes appear

## When to Create Subdirectories

**Create subfolder when:**
- 8+ atomic notes with clear grouping
- Common prefix in filenames (e.g., `play-functions-*.md`)
- Shared topic becomes obvious after writing

**Don't create prematurely:**
❌ Empty folder structure before writing
✅ Write notes first, structure later

## Directory Patterns

**Flat is better than nested:**
```
naming/
├── variables-snake-case.md
├── components-pascalcase.md
└── boolean-prefix.md
```

**Subfolders only for clear groupings** (8+ notes):
```
storybook/
├── documentation/       # 5 notes
├── play-functions/      # 6 notes
└── story-naming.md      # Standalone
```

## Benefits

**Adapts to reality**: Structure reflects actual content
**Reveals connections**: Writing notes reveals unexpected links
**Easy to reorganize**: Not rigid, easy to refactor
**No artificial constraints**: Don't force wrong categories
