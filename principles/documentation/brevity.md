# Brevity

Minimum words for specificity. No unnecessary elaboration.

## Principle

Notes are for **repeat reference**, not first-time learning. Write dense, compact, information-rich.

## Good Example

```markdown
Boolean variables use `is_`, `has_`, or `should_` prefixes.

const is_active = true;
const has_errors = false;
```

Information-dense. Everything needed, nothing extra.

## Bad Example

"When writing code with boolean variables, it's important to follow naming conventions that make it clear that the variable contains a boolean value..."

Same info buried in filler. Wastes time on repeat reads.

## For Repeat Users

Brief notes: Pattern visible in first 3 lines (2 seconds)
